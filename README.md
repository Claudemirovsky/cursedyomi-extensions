# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Aniyomi Extensions
Aniyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android 6.0 and above.

This repository contains the available extension catalogues for the [Aniyomi](https://github.com/aniyomiorg/aniyomi) fork.

# Usage

Extension sources can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Aniyomi app. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

## Downloads

If you prefer to directly download the APK files, they are available via the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/Claudemirovsky/cursedyomi-extensions/tree/repo/apk).

# Requests

Source requests here are meant as up-for-grabs for any developer, thus it's impossible to provide a time estimation for any of them. Furthermore, some sites are impossible to do, usually because of various technical reasons.

# Contributing
